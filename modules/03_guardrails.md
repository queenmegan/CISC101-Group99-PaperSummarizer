New Requirement B: Strengthen Evidence & Hallucination Guardrails (Module 03)

The summarizer should more clearly respect the “only use what’s in the paper” rule and expose that behavior.

You must add BOTH of these guardrails to 03_guardrails.md:

Strict Evidence Mode: Introduce a mode or flag (e.g., evidence_mode = "strict"). When it is set to "strict":

The summarizer should:

Only include claims, equations, and results that appear in the provided text.

If it cannot find enough information, it must say so explicitly (e.g., “The source text does not provide enough detail to summarize this section in strict evidence mode.”).

Section Warning Messages For sections that are:

missing / empty, or

too short (< 50 words)

The module must instruct the system to output a standardized warning, such as:

“Section skipped: no usable text was provided.”

“Section very short: summary may be incomplete.” You decide the exact wording.
